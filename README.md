PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This Project shows the implementation of various algrothims from basic ones
to advance, using data structures from basics ones to advance.
The purpose of this project to focus on understanding of the algorithms and 
underlying data-structures.
The language used in implementation is C.
C is very raw and crude but powerful language to implement algorithms.
It is small languge and can be learnt in short time.
The data type used is very primitive datatype supported by language - INTEGERS.
They are very easy to understand and keep us focused on implementation.

The project is still in development stage but complete.
The algorithms are tested.
But it is open for all to test and break it in every possible way.
